# GUI for DFT-FE
[![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://dft-fe.streamlit.app/)

This [web app](https://dft-fe.streamlit.app/) allows you to create input files for the [DFT-FE](https://github.com/dftfeDevelopers/dftfe) code by selecting a material in the [materialsproject.org](https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/) database or a molecule in the [PubChem database](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
It also allows conversion from various file formats like `CIF`, `XYZ`, `POSCAR`, `CAR`, and `PWSCF` to the `RIPER` format making it easier to adapt `DFT-FE` in your existing workflows. 

`DFT-FE` is a C++ code for materials modeling from first principles using KS-DFT. 

This GitHub repo contains all the source code of a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) web application for helping you set up DFT calculations for `DFT-FE`. 


## Web App
The web app is available at [https://dft-fe.streamlit.app/](https://dft-fe.streamlit.app/).

**Hint**: Use the sidebar menu on the left to navigate between different options.

## About the developer
I am a computational material scientist who likes to work in the area of method development. I have obtained my PhD in Physics from [Friedrich Schiller University Jena (FSU) Germany](https://www.uni-jena.de/), under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Marek Sierka](https://www.cmsg.uni-jena.de/).
My passion lies in developing codes and methods to model the light-matter interaction of hybrid systems.
